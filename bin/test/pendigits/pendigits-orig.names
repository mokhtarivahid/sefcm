4. Relevant Information:

	We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers.
	The samples written by 30 writers are used for training,
	cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits 
	written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This
	database is available in the UNIPEN format.

	We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated 
	LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are
	located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 
	486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet
	sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the
	pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. 

	These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside 
	boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored 
	only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes
	with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to
	write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy
	with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box 
	by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored 
	because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices,
	but subjects are not aware of this. 

	In our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus
	pressure level values are ignored. The raw data that we capture 
	from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 
	(tablet input box resolution). 

	pendigits-orig contain original, unnormalized data. pendigits is the 
	normalized and resampled version where all inputs are of the same
	length. Here because of speed or the digit, feature vectors may be of
	different lengths, e.g., '1' is shorter than '8'.

	The way we used the dataset was to use first half of training for 
	actual training, one-fourth for validation and one-fourth
	for writer-dependent testing. The test set was used for 
	writer-independent testing and is the actual quality measure.

	Input size depends on writing speed and time and is not fixed
